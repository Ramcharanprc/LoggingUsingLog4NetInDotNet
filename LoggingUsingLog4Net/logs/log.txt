WARN  2021-01-30 02:15:12,030 2458792ms HomeController         Index              - System.Exception: Custom log levels can also be defined in configuration. This is convenient for using a custom level in a logger filter or an appender filter. Similar to defining log levels in code, a custom level must be defined first, before it can be used. If a logger or appender is configured with an undefined level, that logger or appender will be invalid and will not process any log events.The CustomLevel configuration element creates a custom level.Internally it calls the same Level.forName() method discussed above.
